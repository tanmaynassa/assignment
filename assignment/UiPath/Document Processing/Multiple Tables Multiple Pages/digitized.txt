Tutoring to Enhance Science Skills Tutoring Two: Learning to Make Data Tables

..............................................................................................

Sample Data for Data Tables

Use these data to create data tables following the Guidelines for Making a Data Table and Checklist for a Data Table.

Example 4: Pet Survey (GR 2-3) Ms.
Hubert's afterschool students took a survey of the 600 students at Morales Elementary School.
Students were asked to select their favorite pet from a list of eight animals.
Here are the results.
Lizard 25, Dog 250, Cat 115, Bird 50, Guinea pig 30, Hamster 45, Fish 75, Ferret 10

Example 5: Electromagnets-Increasing Coils (GR 3-5) The following data were collected using an electromagnet with a 1.5 volt battery, a switch, a piece of #20 insulated wire, and a nail.
Three trials were run.
Safety precautions in repeating this experiment include using safety goggles or safety spectacles and avoiding short circuits.

Number of Coils   Number of Paperclips
5                 3, 5, 4             
10                7, 8, 6             
15                11, 10, 12          
20                15, 13, 14          

Example 6: pH of Substances (GR 5-10) The following are pH values of common household substances taken by three different teams using pH probes.
Safety precautions in repeating this experiment include hooded ventilation, chemical-splash safety goggles, gloves, and apron.
Do not use bleach, ammonia, or strong acids with children.

Lemon juice 2.4, 2.0, 2.2; Baking soda (1 Tbsp) in Water (1 cup) 8.4, 8.3, 8.7; Orange juice 3.5, 4.0, 3.4; Battery acid 1.0, 0.7, 0.5; Apples 3.0, 3.2, 3.5; Tomatoes 4.5, 4.2, 4.0; Bottled water 6.7, 7.0, 7.2; Milk of magnesia 10.5, 10.3, 10.6; Liquid hand soap 9.0, 10.0, 9.5; Vinegar 2.2, 2.9, 3.0; Household bleach 12.5, 12.5, 12.7; Milk 6.6, 6.5, 6.4; Household ammonia 11.5, 11.0, 11.5; Lye 13.0, 13.5, 13.4; and Sodium hydroxide 14.0, 14.0, 13.9; Anti-freeze 10.1, 10.9, 9.7; Windex 9.9.
10.2, 9.5; Liquid detergent 10.5, 10.0, 10.3; and Cola 3.0, 2.5, 3.2

Teaching tip: The pH scale is from 0 to 14.
Have students make two data tables, one with the data as given and one with the pH scale 0 to 14 with the substances' average pH in rank order on the scale (Battery acid at the lower end and Sodium hydroxide at the upper end) or create a pH graphic organizer.
